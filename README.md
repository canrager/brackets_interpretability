# brackets_interpretability

We classify strings of parentheses ```(()())()``` into balanced and unbalanced. The parentheses are balanced if each opening bracket is matched with a closing bracket later in the string. For example, ```(())``` is balanced and ```(()``` is unbalanced. Ultimately, e use a transformer model of size XXX to solve this task.

1. We come up with a simple algorithm on our own.
2. We train a transformer model. The transformer model is trained by YYY.
